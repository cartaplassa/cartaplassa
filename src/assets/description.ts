const description = `
A child prodigy burnt out by middle school. I believe I play guitar well, though I've never sought professional feedback. I'm a native Russian speaker with fluent English. My learning style involves a quick crash course to watch something simple get built and get a grasp on technology in question, and then countless sleepless days of reading documentation while building something more serious. I use Arch Linux as my daily driver for work and Debian as a Windows VM launcher for leisure activities.
